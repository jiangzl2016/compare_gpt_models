      "Article:  A convicted fraudster stole £17,000 from the City firm where she worked after she started embezzling money on her second day in the job. Gabrielle Yinka Saunders, 32, used company credit cards to pay for her £10,000 wedding, as well as a £5,000 honeymoon in the Seychelles. She was arrested at Heathrow when she returned from the honeymoon - but now she has been spared jail even though a court heard that she had been convicted of fraud twice previously. Just married: But Gabrielle Yinka Saunders, pictured during her wedding to David Osborne, stole £17,000 to pay for the ceremony and her luxury honeymoon . Fraud: Saunders, pictured outside the Old Bailey, admitted cheating her company out of thousands of pounds . Saunders, also known as Gabriella Osborne since getting married at Belair House in Dulwich last September, stole £35,000 from her previous employer PriceWaterhouseCoopers, where she worked as a tax accountant. After serving a jail sentence, she started a £40,000-a-year job as a personal assistant at Insight Investments in June last year. But she proceeded to embezzle a total of £17,000 using her colleagues' credit cards - including £600 for flowers, £270 on a new watch, £210 on a new outfit and £400 for a mobile phone. The Old Bailey heard Saunders came to the UK from Nigeria and graduated from Southampton University with a law degree in 2004, before starting work at PwC. While working at the multinational firm, Saunders forged taxi receipts to destinations across the country at up to £250 a time, then signed them off by faking a colleague's signature. Couple: Saunders was convicted of fraud twice before her latest offence . Free: Saunders, pictured with her husband in an engagement photo, was spared jail . Celebration: But Saunders was arrested at Heathrow when the couple returned from their honeymoon . In 2007 she was jailed for six months for fraud, and in 2011 she was again convicted of fraud but spared jail after a court heard she had stolen money from neighbour using credit cards. The day after Saunders started working at Insight Investments in June, she charged £5,272 to a colleague's credit card in order to pay travel agent Trailfinders for her luxury honeymoon with husband David Osborne. Mugshot: Saunders pictured after she was jailed for a £35,000 fraud in 2007 . In September she used another colleague's card to pay £10,254 to Belair House, £268.20 to the jeweller Andrew Charles, £597 to PESH flowers, £208.44 to fashion store ASOS and £390 to EE T-mobile. Prosecutor Roger Daniells-Smith said: 'She paid for a prestige wedding venue, she paid for the flowers, she paid for her honeymoon outfit and clothing. 'She paid for phone calls to make these arrangements and she paid for the gift of a watch. She paid for the honeymoon which was a first-class trip to Dubai and then on to the Seychelles. 'They were arrested at Heathrow when they returned to the UK and she made no comment in interview, but it was clear from the evidence that she was solely responsible for these frauds.' Saunders, from Camberwell in south London, admitted seven counts of fraud totalling £16,990, and was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment suspended for two years, with 200 hours of unpaid work. Judge Stephen Gullick decided against jailing her after he was told that she had repaid the money and was retraining as a teacher. He said: 'You have a singularly unimpressive record and you have already served a prison sentence some time ago. Pricey: Saunders spent £10,000 of her firm's money to book Belair House for her wedding reception . Honeymoon: She also stole £5,000 to pay for a luxury post-wedding break in the Seychelles . 'You did not disclose your previous dishonesty to your employers, who were prepared to take you on as an administrative assistant on a good salary. 'The fact is within days you were prepared to take advantage. You effectively defrauded others to the tune of £17,000, all of which has been paid back. That money was used to finance your wedding and the subsequent honeymoon. 'You have now started working in a completely different environment. I hope they will never place you in a position of trust with anything to do with money. 'These were serious offences but it appears you are turning your life around. If you continue to commit offences of dishonest of this nature you will eventually receive a very long sentence of imprisonment indeed.'\n",

      "Article:  After a fire took a family's home of four years leaving them without anything, a Georgia mother of six is making a desperate plea for help. Kalimah Dixon said she was awakened by a neighbor yelling there was a fire early on Monday morning, and was lucky to get her children, aged one to 14, out of the Decatur condo safely. However, all that was left of her rented condo was a pile of rubble, and in her efforts to get her family back on their feet, she is asking for assistance. 'My children are homeless. They have nothing. They lost everything,' Dixon told Channel 2. Scroll down for video . A mother of six said her family has nothing after fire reduced their Georgia condo to a pile of rubble (above Kalimah Dixon with her five of her six children) The Dekalb County mother said the fire happened early on Monday and that she managed to get all of her children safely out (remains of the condo following the fire above) While Dixon was renting the Condo in the last four years, she had quit working to enroll full time in school to complete her degree in business management. But now she is finding it difficult to get a lease for a new permanent home  while being unemployed. As the mother of three sons and three daughters shuffles to give her kids stability, she is currently staying with a friend, far from her children's Decatur schools - where On Tuesday, Georgia students are required to take a standardized test.

They have nothing. They lost everything' She said in the past few days, the American Red Cross has assisted her as she searched for a place to live, but as she has looked to shelters for help, they turn her away. 'They'll take three of my children but they won't take the other three or my son is too old or they have any space at all,' Dixon told Channel 2. Dixon has since started a GoFundMe page which on Sunday had raised $4,619 in donations. Dixon has started a GoFundMe page which has raised $4,619 in donations so far .

      "Article:  Ed Balls was today accused of 'letting the cat out of the bag' on tax rises after leaving the door open to trapping more middle-class workers in the 40p tax rate. In an interview the shadow chancellor repeatedly refused to rule out trying to balance the books by lowering the amount workers have to earn before they pay the higher income tax rate. The number of people paying 40p tax has already risen from about 2million to 5million in two decades, but the Tories have promised to lift the threshold if they are returned to power. Scroll down for video . Shadow chancellor Ed Balls, pictured giving a speech in Glasgow today, has repeatedly refused to rule out using the point at which the higher income tax rate kicks in to raise money to balance the books . The Shadow Chancellor was joined by the Scottish Labour Leader Jim Murphy at the Royal Concert hall in Glasgow today . Labour has vowed not to increase VAT or National Insurance as part of measures to bring down the deficit if they win the election. But pressed on income tax, Mr Balls refused to rule out freezing or lowering the threshold to raise millions from people earning more than £41,865. In an interview on ITV Westcountry, Mr Balls was asked if was 'leaving the door open tonight to changing the tax thresholds that mean people in that 40 per cent bracket could be paying more tax under you'. The shadow chancellor refused to rule it out: 'What I would like to do is find ways in which I could have fewer people in the 40 per cent tax bracket. Of course I would. 'But I have to be honest with people. The deficit is going to be £90 billion. I have got to find a way to get the deficit down in a careful, and staged and balanced way.' He said he would not be 'raising the higher rate of income tax' but left open the possibility of holding or lowering the point at which it kicks in. 'What I cannot do is go through every detail of the tax system. It's really complicated. 'I am not going to make unfunded commitment to do so, because I fear in the end that will be a VAT rise from the Tories. You won't get that from me.' Pressed on whether he plans to change the income tax bands, Mr Balls said: 'I can't go through every detail.' He went on: 'I can make a promise not to increase the basic rate of income tax or the higher rate of income tax. The threshold is also an important detail and that's complex.' Chancellor George Osborne, visiting the Marston's Brewery in Wolverhampton with David Cameron today. claimed Mr Balls had 'let the cat out of the bag . The number of people paying 40p tax has already risen by about two million to five million in two decades . Chancellor George Osborne said: 'Ed Balls has let the cat out of the bag and confirmed a tax assault on middle earners. He has confirmed that he and Ed Miliband will put up taxes on middle Britain. It is part of Labour's £3,000 tax rise for working families. 'By contrast, the Conservative plan is to increase to £50,000 the threshold at which people pay the higher rate of tax. So there is a clear choice. 'Economic security and lower taxes with David Cameron and our long-term economic plan. Or economic chaos and higher taxes under Ed Miliband.' David Cameron has warned the 40p tax rate is hitting too many people on 'middle incomes'. The Prime Minister claims it is wrong that millions of people doing normal jobs like teaching are now paying a tax rate that was 'only ever meant for the better off'. The Conservatives go into the election pledging to raise the threshold for paying 40p tax from £41,865 to £50,000 by 2020. Workers would also pay no income tax on the first £12,500 they earn. But Labour says the policy is a £7billion unfunded tax cut at a time when billions are needed in spending cuts. A Labour spokesman said: 'Under the Tories around 2 million more people have been dragged into the 40p tax band, but Labour supported the increases in the 40p threshold in the recent Budget. 'Tory promises to raise the 40p threshold further are completely unfunded and will cost billions of pounds. Together with their extreme spending plans, these unfunded commitments will mean the Tories end up raising VAT again and cutting the NHS. 'When we make tax promises, such as introducing a lower 10p starting rate of tax to help millions on middle and low incomes, we have set out where the money is coming from. 'Working people are paying more under this government, which is why the only tax changes we are proposing are on the very richest in society like reversing the Tory tax cut for millionaires.'\n",

      "Article:  Bristol City will become the first Football League club to win promotion this season should they beat Bradford on Tuesday night. The League One leaders managed to come away from second-placed Preston North End unscathed, drawing 1-1 thanks to Aaron Wilbraham’s equaliser after Jermaine Beckford had opened the scoring just before the hour. Regardless, Steve Cotterill’s side had been destined not to seal promotion at Deepdale because results elsewhere didn’t go their way. Bristol City manager Steve Cotterill was happy to avoid defeat against Preston on Saturday . Three points at Bradford on Tuesday will do the trick. It would take something to go seriously awry for the Robins not to be returning to the second tier after a two-year absence, and they did their job well enough to prevent any late scares in the north west. ‘That’ll be good,’ Cotterill said. ‘We’ll digest that and try and prepare properly for the game. ‘It was important not to get beat here. If you look at it, if we had and then got nothing at Bradford (on Tuesday) then we’re stuck on 88 points. Preston would’ve gone to 83 points today and then have Gillingham at home. ‘You always look at the worst case scenario.’ Bristol City’s elevation to the second tier appears a formality, and Preston remain in pole position to join them. Nevertheless, manager Simon Grayson has warned his players not to get carried away. ‘We’ve said to the players we can only influence our own games, but it’s another point to our tally and another game chalked off,’ he said. ‘But there will be no complacency from the team, we know we have to keep working.’ Cotterill, meanwhile, has always gunned for the League One title rather than just promotion and this result preserved their eight-point lead over Preston, although they have played a game more. His squad are staying in a nearby hotel until the trip to Valley Parade and will train at Burnley in preparation.\n",

      "Article:  A restaurant customer in the Mexican border town of Tijuana was left horrified after witnessing staff butchering a dog to be served up as a pork dish on the menu. The authorities have closed a total of six Chinese restaurants in the local area since police raided the Lo Yen City restaurant in southern Tijuana following a tip-off from the disgusted client. The customer called in the cops after witnessing kitchen staff killing the dog, later intended to be served up masquerading as pork in the next chow mein. Scroll down for video . Disgusted: A restaurant customer in Tijuana was left horrified after witnessing staff butchering a dog to be served up as a pork dish on the menu. Pictured is a dead dog police recovered at the establishment . The authorities have closed a total of six Chinese restaurants in the local area since local police raided the Lo Yen City restaurant (pictured) in southern Tijuana . Officers conducting a raid of the restaurant on Wednesday morning discovered caged dogs in the kitchen, a decapitated puppy in the trash and the owner himself in the process of decapitating and butchering a canine carcass, putting the meat in a cooking pot. Owner Yu Yu Chou told local newspaper reporters: 'I admit to killing the dog, but the meat is for my own personal use, not for my customers.' Police received a tip-off from a restaurant client who heard the sounds of a howling dog at the back of the establishment. After peeking over the back fence to investigate, the horrified client witnessed two cooks in the act of killing the defenceless animal. In total five arrests were made at Mr Yu Yu Chou's restaurant, including three workers of Chinese nationality . An official was filmed pulling a beheaded dog from a storage barrel during the raid . Boast: The restaurant advertises the quality of its 'home-style food' but has had complaints from customers before about flies and cockroaches in their food . Rescued: Some dogs were found alive at the restaurant and were taken away by a local vet . Lucky: This dog was saved from the owner's knives by the police. The picture is a grab from a local news agency video of the property . Upon arrival at the scene, police officers said they witnessed the cooks hurriedly throw a decapitated dog carcass in a kitchen waste bin. Officers later saw the owner decapitating and butchering a dog in the back alley. The restaurant, which advertises the quality of its 'home-style food' claims never to have received complaints of using dog meat before. The owner, while handcuffed in the back of a police vehicle, said: 'We've had complaints from customers who have found hair, flies or cockroaches in their food, but never anything this serious.' The AFN news agency took video evidence of the police bust. It contains footage of a hair-strewn alley where the dogs were seen being butchered, a terrified dog chained to the wall and a forensics officer pulling a decapitated canine carcass – stiffened by rigor mortis – out of a kitchen waste bin. The animals, some of which survived, were removed from the scene in a veterinarian's van. Samples of meat were also taken from the kitchen fridges in order to determine the origin of the meat. Following local authorities' demands to investigate kitchens in other local oriental eating establishments, five other Chinese restaurants in the area did not open their doors to customers on Wednesday, leading many to question whether the cooking of dog meat has long been practiced in Tijuana. In total five arrests were made at Mr Yu Yu Chou's restaurant, including three workers of Chinese nationality. A spokesman for the Mexican Ministry of Health told local reporters following the incident that the city would be pursuing conviction of the Mr Yu Yu Chou, and that 'you can't play with the health of Tijuana'. The infamous frontier town in Baja California state sits directly on the United States border, just three miles from downtown San Diego. The town has long had a dangerous reputation, not least for the criminal cartel activity which sees drugs and humans trafficked across the border into the United States.\n",

      "Review:  The acting, other reviews notwithstanding, was remarkably well-done. Brad Pitt handles the role of an annoying, obnoxious Austrian climber quite well. Other acting is fine. The story could have been riveting, but somehow, it misses - one never really understands or cares for the characters shown, and so the story, which could have been quite dramatic, fails to draw in this audience.<br /><br />Beautiful scenery and cinematography, a remarkably dramatic true story, important events that shaped the world that we live in - but I could not, try as I might, involve myself in this story. As an unabashed Brad Pitt fan (I consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation), I expected to *love* this flick - and yet, it left me cold.<br /><br />It could be a failing within myself, but I tend to point toward the creative end of this movie - direction, scriptwriting, production, editing - somehow, they lost me. It's a shame, because it could have been wonderful.<br /><br />Good acting, dramatic story, beautifully shot - it should have been magnificent. It wasn't. Probably worth watching, just to make your own mind up on it - but don't expect too much, and perhaps you won't be as disappointed as I was. Mostly, it bored me.\n",

      "Review:  I desperately need this on a tape, not a DVD, and soon!<br /><br />I have one nephew who is in the infantry but has not yet deployed, although he set to go to Iraq soon after December 2008. I lost my beloved step son in Ramadi Iraq on 09-15-05 from an unmanned missile in a green zone. I have another nephew who is joining the army as soon as he graduates from high school this spring because he, like his older brother, has some idealized and romanticized idea about what serving in the military is. My stepson died after only 10 days in country and he never went out on any missions so my nephews have no way to reference any of the experiences shown in this candid documentary from any type of personal experiences that might have been conveyed by my now deceased son. <br /><br />There is nothing I can do about those who are in, or now gone, but I have one left that has not raised his hand and been sworn in YET. I desperately want him to do so informed, none of the others did.<br /><br />Pleases help me with this.<br /><br />The movie documentary The Ground Truth is the best visual reference I have ever seen. I need to somehow make my youngest nephew see what he is getting himself into before it is to late. BUT: ( do not laugh )I NEED my mother to see this first. She must actually see and hear these men and women, not simply the idea of them, but the truth of what they will be immersed in, possibly forever. Then she will have the emotional determination to make my brother watch this film and once he has then he may then make his son, my youngest nephew, watch it too. Then, my nephew might begin to take this seriously. <br /><br />((( is there another time when this will be shown on TV ? if so please tell me when ? )))<br /><br />However, my problem is, my mother does not own a DVD player, she still uses video ( is that correct? with tapes ? ) So, I need to find a way for her to be able to watch this film. Can I purchase this from anyone in that form? If not, is there any other way for me to get this in the form of a tape from anyone? Is there any legitimate link from which I can pay to download it onto my computer and then transfer it to a tape. If so who would I contact. I will gladly pay for the privilege providing it is a legitimate link. <br /><br />Or,if you have any alternative ideas I will consider anything you can suggest.<br /><br />Please help me, I have lost one very precious adored and loved one already, I already know my oldest nephew will never be the same when he returns and I may loose him too. I cannot loose three and the emotional toll for all of those that do make it back is too high a price to pay for every male child in my family of that generation. Please help me. I will happily call you, email me a number if that is the best way to get the needed information. Thank you so much for any help you can offer.<br /><br />Sincerely, Lori Swanberg l.swanberg@yahoo.com\n",

      "Review:  Written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma, SCARFACE paints a picture not easily forgotten. Al Pacino turns in a stunning performance as Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee than becomes a powerful player in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his self made kingdom of crime in Florida. This gangster flick is harsh, violent, loud, gross, unpleasant and must hold the record for uttering the word \"f--k\" the most number of times. Almost three hours long, and yes it can get repulsive. A stout hearted constitution keeps you in your seat cheering for the demise of a ruthless crime lord.<br /><br />Also playing interesting characters are Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, F. Murray Abraham and Angel Salazar. Pacino proves to be one of the greatest of his generation. He manages to bring reality to his character that leaves a strong impression. This will not be a movie for everyone for you leave thinking you walked away from a disaster. Is that powerful enough for you? Crime does not pay for long!\n",
